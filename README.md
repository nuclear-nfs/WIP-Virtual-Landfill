# ðŸ¤” I can't find some malwares. Where are they? ðŸ¤”
Some people's malwares, e.g. kapi2.0peys's, are in a release, because the folder is too large (>25 MB).

# ðŸ¤” I can't find any malware. Where is it? ðŸ¤”
This GitHub repository is divided into branches instead of folders. For example, if you want Clutt6.6.6 by ClutterTech, you must go to the GDI branch, not the main branch.
